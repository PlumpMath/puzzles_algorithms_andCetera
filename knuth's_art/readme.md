This folder is for problems from Donald Knuth's "The Art of Computer Programming", volumed by folder.

At the time of this writing (Nov 16 2015) all of my solutions are my work only -- meaning to the extent that I've delved into the solutions, it's been on problems I haven't been programming solutions to.  Reason is simple: I'm actually doing this whole exercise to improve my own confidence (that I'm really a decent programmer) as a programmer rather than to impress potential employers or peer judges.  Of course I'm also doing it for the raw practice too.  So my solutions probably aren't optimal, and in some cases may have flawed implementations.

The one problem I'm working on now (23 from volume 3) I actually have seen the solution to some time ago.  I found it byzantine and bizarre and confusing, but I kind of got the constructive approach and in the last few days as I picked this problem up again I think I see an approach that would work for solving this problem-- not totally sure if it is or isn't the same as the solution in the book -- again, because I'm trying to do my own work self-reliantly as much as possible, I'm avoiding to look at Knuth's solution until I'm done.  The first part of it anyway isn't the solution algorithm itself but trying to set up the sample data-space on which to test any given algorithm.  This means for problem 23 setting up the list of relations over a population sized 4096, without redundancies, etc.  Actually a good exercise in and of itself.  

More later -- cheers,
Wylie
