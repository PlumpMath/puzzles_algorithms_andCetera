edge cases report:

I got an email from the company regarding the tests. I'll provide more info and maybe share the document here when I get the time.
Doesn't have the testcase data, but has a bit more detail on scoring.  
I was able to verify that my code fails with edge case "03 38" a four digit phone number and maybe probably two digit phone numbers as well.  Not clear if this should result in axing half the score down to basically failing level, especially if they don't provide this during the test runs prior to submission (accounting for this edge case in code would take 5 minutes or less).   [edit just fixed for that edge case, yeah it took less than 5 minutes, just added a conditional to test for `former.length > 0` ].  Yet for this edge case, and maybe another like it (2 digit phone number) they took half my test score.  They awarded me 50% score on that question.

The mystery of task-3 continues; I have more email inqiries in progress, will write more later.
