Normally I wouldn't publish their stuff, but I've found serious scoring irregularities with my tests through them.  After inquiries I have received no response.  So, publishing them to keep a record.

For example, in folder `conf_cann`, I have (afaik, perhaps missing an edge case) perfectly correct solutions for task2 and task3, but received scores of like 40% and 25% for those.  Unlike on an academic test, Codility doesn't show you the test-cases/calculations that lead to the score, it's quite an opaque process and therefore subject to some (intentional or not) errors in their process.
