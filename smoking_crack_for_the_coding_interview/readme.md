These are my work to solve problems from the book "Cracking the Coding Interview"

At the time of this writing (Nov 16 2015) all of my solutions are my work only -- meaning to the extent that I've delved into the solutions, it's been on problems I haven't been programming solutions to.  Reason is simple: I'm actually doing this whole exercise to improve my own confidence (that I'm really a decent programmer) as a programmer rather than to impress potential employers or peer judges.  Of course I'm also doing it for the raw practice too.  So my solutions probably aren't optimal, and in some cases may have flawed implementations.
