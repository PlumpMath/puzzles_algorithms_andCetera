Some weeks back I had an online automated coding interview featuring a coding assignment requiring something like an implementation of a low-level evaluator, such as used by compilers, and things that enable building higher level programming languages.

I don't have access to the assignment requirements, so I'm not sure if it was required to implement an operator precedence algorithm in the evaluator, but I tried to do this anyways.  Having no idea what I was doing, I flailed spectacularly for a week plus in repeated absurd attempts.  Eventually I gave up, did some research, found the shunting yard algorithm, the way it works with postfix expressions and  the stack structure, etc. 

So this section is for that exercise and other related material that comes up.
