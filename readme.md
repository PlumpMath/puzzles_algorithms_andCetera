### Coding Puzzles, Algorithms, &Cetera

I'm going to do a repo just for these exercises in pure programming -- meaning devoid of immediate application.

Puzzles, algorithms, data structures.

For now everything is out of a book called _Cracking the Coding Interview_, but I'll be getting into some other books, and then also looking around online for contests and stuff.  

I have the Knuth books too, _Art of Computer Programming_, so maybe I'll take a crack at some of the problems in there again.
