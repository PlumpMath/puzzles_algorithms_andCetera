### Coding Puzzles, Algorithms, &Cetera

I'm going to do a repo just for these exercises in pure programming -- meaning devoid of immediate application.

Puzzles, algorithms, data structures.

Some really fun problems are out a book called _Cracking the Coding Interview_ (in the section with the funny name), but I'll be getting into some other books, and then also looking around online weird hackathon type stuff as well, and whatever else I come across.
